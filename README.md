# Melon Pants

When life gives you melons, make melon pants! Create various melon based items like armour and Jack o'Melons! Play on either Forge or Fabric for any (Soon) 1.20.X version!

Melon Pants is a mod that adds various melon based items. It was inspire by this Melon Pants clip from YouAlwaysWin (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za_Dqgod-8U). I used to watch their old Minecraft stuff and come back every once in a while. I had this clip recommended to me and wondered if there was a mod that added Melon Pants, there was but it was outdated. So I decided to create a mod centred around Melon Pants, it has expanted to a general melon based mod but the Pants remain the centre.
